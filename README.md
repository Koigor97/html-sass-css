The goal of this repository is create beautiful, simple, static websites. This would be done with focus on    
responsive website principles in mind, semantic HTML, and most especially Web Accessibilty. The internet is  
for everyone, which means websites should be built with People with disability in mind. It just makes you a  
better human. I will be using W3C as my main resource to achieve that.
